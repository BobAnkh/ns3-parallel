# ns3-parallel

A Multitask Parallel Concurrent Executor for ns-3 (network simulator).

## Usage

Define your config struct and param struct, implement trait `BuildParam` for the first and trait `BuildCmd` for the second.

Then call the `ExecutorBuilder` to build a `Executor`. Then launch the tasks, wait for the results.

Examples see `examples/simple.rs`.

To run the example, you can first execute the script `setup-ns3.sh` then execute `cargo run --example simple` in the root directory.
